The task is to predict whether a flight will experience a type of interference before takeoff, which is a classification problem. Predicting flight interference before takeoff enhances operational efficiency and safety, reducing delays and improving passenger experience by addressing potential issues proactively. Our solution employs a RandomForest model, a method that leverages predictive analytics to address the challenge of forecasting flight delays, enhancing operational efficiency and safety through the analysis of historical data patterns and features.
